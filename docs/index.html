				<h2> Description </h1>
					<p> A 2 player, augmented-reality, battle-simulator. 2 Players can engage in fantasy themed combat utilizing 3 different unit types
					on their Android devices. Using Google's ARcore libraries players will lead their armies into combat on a world placed into their own 
					environment. Players can watch the combat unfold up close or from a distance as they move around the 3D world. 
					</p>

					<h3>Influences</h3>
					<p>We were influenced to build a real time strategy game by some of the more famous series in the genre such as the Total War series 
					and Age of Empires. We were also influenced by the challenge of bringing some aspects of the genre into an AR environment. Above all 
					we wanted to make a game that got people's attention. Once it had their attention, it would show them something they hadn't seen before,
					a strategy game, where the player is the camera. Giving people the perspective of hovering over the board, and controlling armies in 
					major clashes is something the strategy genre has always tried to do. AR gives people to live out this ability in their own world. For us
					making this game was a first step in that direction. </p>

					<h3>Reflection</h3>
					<p>The one thing that we believe that we beleive we succeeded at, was taking a difficult concept, and executing onto it. We think we have 
					built an interesting game that exists in an augmented reality environment. Evidence of this fact has come from our play testing. Much of the feedback
					that we have gotten has praised our game for what we were able to build in AR. This leads into what we wish we had more time for. With much of the 
					praise our game received, it also received a number of valid criticisms that we wish we had more time to address. 
						<ol>
							<li>Better UI for selecting units and seeing information on their status.</li>
							<li>Better balance of strengths/weaknesses between the units</li>
							<li>A game world with more terrain and features, and even randomized terrain</li>
						</ol>
					If we had two more weeks, we think that these ideas could be implemented and would make our game more enjoyable.
