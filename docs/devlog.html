						<li><h4> Beta Feedback </h4></li>
						<p> Feedback from the beta test was very positive! People really liked the novelty of the AR
						    and enjoyed the look of the game. People had very good criticisms related to unit management. 
						    It is hard to distnguish between teams for peasant units. Tutorilization is lacking and needs to 
						    be implemented. Win conditions would help with the pacing of the game. From what we noticed the initial 
						    setup can be confusing, as we had to walk people through. The beta tests left us feeling there 
							was a lot of positive reception for the game. </p>

				<h3> June 8th, 2019 </h3>
					<ul>
						<li><h4> Completed </h4></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Final version of the game (Everyone)</li>
								<li>The game website (Everyone)</li>
							</ul>
						<li><h4> Working On</h4></li>
							<ul>
								<li>Game Trailer (Mitchell)</li>
								<li>Packaging of game source and github repo (Everyone)</li>
							</ul>
						<li><h4> Final Playtest Feedback </h4></li>
							<a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1yV0NjagV89bOquonF4hudtryEqeSKmFFgsEfbzq_en0/edit?usp=sharing">Playtest Survey Results</a>
							<p>From both our own outstide playtesting and the final day of playtesting in class we were able to have 20 final playtesters. These people
							saw the final version of our game and responses were positive. We were able to see people play through our game and get valuable feedback in
							terms of what would make the game better. A common response in both our outside playtesting and the playtesting we did in class was that it 
							was difficult at times to tell what was going on. Another common response is that there was difficulty selecting units once the two armies 
							were engaged in combat. Adding some sort of unit hotbar/selection menu might help with selecting the units. Something we noticed is that people
							really enjoyed moving around the combat, getting close to the action, pulling away, and moving around the game world seem to be a common occurence.
							People explored the space and looked at the game from different angles. This game really showed the uniqueness augmented reality can bring to the game.
